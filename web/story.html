            <h1>Developer's Story</h1>
            <p>In this short article I will share my little story of developing this game.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    I think it all started when I stumbled upon 
                    <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/20140407-geneva-tedx-talk-free-software-free-society">
                    Richard Stallman's TEDx talk</a> 
                    on free software. It has changed my view on software a lot. I realized 
                    that proprietary software, as Stallman says, is an instrument of unjust 
                    power. Companies are surely eager to take advantage of such instrument 
                    for greed by neglecting digital human rights. The importance of these rights is 
                    obviously growing in today's society, where technology is being centralized more
                    and more in hands of corporations. Free software is one of essential steps to 
                    digital freedom, to put the technology under society's control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I researched the topic of software, I wanted to install 
                    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/">a free distibution</a>
                    of a GNU/Linux system. One of such distributions is <a href="https://pureos.net">PureOS</a>, developed 
                    by a social purpose corporation <a href="https://puri.sm">Purism</a>. Social purpose corporation 
                    is basically a company that has legally committed to benefit society and that 
                    puts social good above profits. It seemed to be that they are the most progressed 
                    company in this fully-free-software world, so I started looking into PureOS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PureOS uses <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME desktop environment</a>, 
                    which packages a lot of <a href="https://gtk.org">GTK</a> applications. 
                    So I saw this project of mine as an opportunity 
                    to get familiar with developing applications using GTK. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I was reading about GTK, I also learned about <a href="https://glade.gnome.org">Glade</a>, 
                    which is a tool for designing 
                    user interfaces for GTK, so I consider myself quite lucky that I didn't have to program
                    the majority of the user interface manually.
                </p>

                <h2>Program Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    This is not my first time developing applications, so I noticed that there is not so much 
                    content on GTK, particularly complete app development tutorials, as with other (and more popular) 
                    frameworks, so I had to come up with a project structure quite intuitively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided that there will be three main components of the program: the user interface, a handler that
                    manages it, and some object that controls the game's logic and its data.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/chart.png" alt="Program structure">
                    <figcaption>Program structure</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    I took advantage of the capabilities (signals, that is) that GTK's GObject provides to communicate changes in 
                    the game object to the UI handler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, in the end, we have this: the game object inherits from GObject to gain the power to emit signals, that 
                    something happened in the game, to the UI handler, that in response to these signals modifies widgets in 
                    the user interface, so it corresponds to reality. And the other way around: the player clicks something in the 
                    user interface, a GTK widget emits a signal that the UI handler catches. The UI handler then calls a method 
                    of the game object, and the game object processes the call with the data it has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can describe my development process as a procces of constant trial and error. There were a lot 
                    of things I didn't know as I was only staring with GTK, so some problems that I have encountered took hours to 
                    solve. 
                </p>

                <h2>What Could Be Added</h2>
                <p>
                    As I heavily focused on developing a GUI application rather than a console one, I might have 
                    neglected the possibility of adding a computer opponent to the game. Unfortunately, I have no time 
                    to implement this now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to add sound effects so the game is more lively, but that stayed unaccomplished as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it also could be great to have more customization of the field (choosing specific size of the field), 
                    the players (adding more players, changing colors of the players), and so on.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What I Have Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time programming a real app using GTK and Python in general. It's also the first 
                    time I wrote documentation that is serious enough and fully fledged unit tests. I hope this experience will 
                    help me somehow in the future!
                </p>

                <h2>The End</h2>
                <p>Thank you for reading this!</p>

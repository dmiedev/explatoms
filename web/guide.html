                <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                <p>The game are played by two players: red and blue.</p>
                <p>
                    The game is taking place on a field of squares, on which 
                    the players place colored atoms. When a square contains 
                    as many atoms as there are neighbouring squares, the atoms explode: 
                    they are spread across the neighbouring squares, simultaneously changing the 
                    color of atoms located on them. 
                </p>
                <p>Each player's goal is to leave no further moves to one's opponent.</p>

                <h3>More Details</h3>
                <p>
                    There are three types of squares:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                            <th>Becomes full at</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Corner</td>
                            <td>In the corners of the field</td>
                            <td>2 atoms</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Wall</td>
                            <td>Beside the walls (excluding the corners)</td>
                            <td>3 atoms</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Normal</td>
                            <td>The rest of the squares</td>
                            <td>4 atoms</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>
                    The way that one can leave no moves to one's opponent is 
                    simple enough: once there are a lot of atoms on the field,
                    the probability of "explosion loops" (i.e. atoms exploding 
                    infinitely) fairly increases.

                <h2>Running the Program</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the only way to run the game for now is 
                    by building from source.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Install PyGObject.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Follow the steps from 
                                <a href="https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html"
                                target="_blank">here</a> to install PyGObject.

                            <li>
                                You don't need to create any scripts as it says in the instruction, 
                                follow only the steps related to the installation.
                            </li>

                    <li>Windows users: copy the source code directory to <code>C:\msys64\home\your-username</code>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Navigate to the source code directory (e.g. <code>cd explatoms</code>).

                    <li>
                        Execute <code>python3 explatoms</code>.

                <h2>Using the Program</h2>
                <p>The user interface of the game is quite intuitive.</p>
                <p>
                    Once you run the game, you will see a window with the field of squares.
                    Field's default size is medium (8x8).
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/first_run.png" alt="The main window" height="400">
                    <figcaption>The main window after first run.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    You can start playing instantly. The blue player
                    always goes first. Click on a square where you want to 
                    place your atom and now let your opponent make a move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also create 
                    a smaller or a bigger field by clicking 
                    the menu button at the top left and selecting "New Game". 
                    In the new game dialog you can select the desired field size.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/new_game.png" alt="The menu and the new game dialog." height="400">
                    <figcaption>The menu and the new game dialog.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>When the game finishes, you will see a dialog that says who won.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/game_over.png" alt="The game over dialog." height="400">

                </figure>
                <p>
                    To start a new game, you have to create a new field by clicking 
                    the menu button at the top left and selecting "New Game".
